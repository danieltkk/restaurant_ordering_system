# Restaurant Ordering System Group Project
Showcasing the backend code done for a restaurant ordering system

This program is developed in C++ to streamline the process of taking orders, managing tables, generating bills, and maintaining a history log of bill payments. This system is designed to enhance the efficiency of restaurant operations and provide a better experience for both customers and staff. Let's break down the key features and components of this system:

**Table Management:**
- The system handles a restaurant with 5 to 10 tables. Each table can be identified by a unique table number.

**Menu Management:**
- The system supports a menu with 5 to 20 different dishes, each with its corresponding dish code and price.

**Ordering Process:**
- The system allows staff to take orders from customers by selecting dishes from the menu and assigning them to specific tables.
- Each order includes information such as the table number, individual dish codes, and quantities.

**Ordered Dish List:**
- The system provides an "Ordered Dishes" option that displays a complete list of all dishes currently ordered by customers from all tables.
- This feature helps staff keep track of ongoing orders and ensure accurate preparation.

**Bill Generation:**
- The system calculates the total bill amount for each table based on the ordered dishes and their quantities.
- It generates bills that include details such as table number, individual dish codes, quantities, and the total bill amount.

**Bill Log:**
- The system maintains a "Bill Log" option that displays a history log of bill payments.
- This log includes information about each bill payment, such as the table number, individual dish codes, quantities, and total bill amount.

**Problem-Solving and Accuracy:**
- The system's back-end has been rigorously tested to ensure the accuracy of calculations and the proper functioning of features.
- Demonstrated problem-solving abilities highlight your proficiency in identifying and resolving issues within the system.

**Robustness and User-Friendliness:**
- The system is designed to be robust, handling various scenarios and inputs effectively.
